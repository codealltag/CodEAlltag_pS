Dear Mrs Israel,

I wrote my essay but I didn't use the books because for me I could find better sources in the Internet and on powerpoint slides. I get another pp presentation from a friend from another course and I worked with yours, the internet and those slides. I hope this isn't such a big problem but that was much easier for me.
My question is, how should I mark this in my essay? Behind the parts I chose or at the end?

I hope you can help me with my questions.

Have a good break!

Greetings
Luana
